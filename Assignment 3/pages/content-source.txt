				<h3>Fundamentals</h3>

Which should account for most all applications. you can divide the twelve spaces however you choose but the but it is not divisible by more than 12.

				<h3>One Size Fits All</h3>
				<p>Learning Bootstrap allows me to understand not only its utility but also it's limitation. It is not exactly a one stop shop for special things. The good news is that the publishers of Bootstrap have a wonderful website containing all necessary references at the link below. The project is currently open source and being improved upon. Bootstrap 4 is currently under development and should provide some cool new features when it comes about. For now i'll just stick to the basics. </p>

				<h3>Differences</h3>
				<p>Bootstrap is great opposed to writing your own Front-End Framworks and scripts because quite simply it's all done for you. Why reinvent the wheel? If you're into doing things the hard way go somewhere else. If you aren't click the link below to check some in browser live manipulation of Bootstrap.</p>

				<h3>Differences</h3>
				<p>One of the challenges I ecountered using Bootstrap was that it was my first experience using a CSS library. Understanding how a library works is crucial to Web Development know how as new concepts are built every day. CSS proved especially tricky due to it's inheritance properties. When you are defining classes from a library I found it more difficult to manipulate the CSS from a local (non-library) stylesheet. Luckily for us there are some tools that will help debug these issues. One tool that can be used with Mozilla is <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, however if you are using Google Chrome you can press F12 and use the Chrome DevTools to work out the kinks. If you are using any version of Internet Explorer you need reevalute your standard of living.</p>

				<h3>This Column</h3>
				<p>This is the column we must not speak of. A column so dastardly bold it cannot be spoken of. Sesame Street hates it. The Internet hates it. The critics hate it. It is highly unadvisable to click the link below</p>
